## Personal Project

-  **[Lunar AIccord — Autonomous RAG-Powered Fragrance Design Agent](https://github.com/Ranykh/lunar-aiccord-agent)**  
  An autonomous LangGraph agent that turns a user’s brief into an IFRA-aware fragrance formula—using OpenAI, RAG over Qdrant note/material databases, and strict prompt-engineered proportioning—then evaluates and brands the result end-to-end.
